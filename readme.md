# Apply an Improved Genetic Algorithm to Optimize a Resource Allocation Problem 

Shixun Xu

This repo contains the code for the paper "Routing Optimization and Wireless Resource Allocation in a Smart Production Network Enabled by Computing Power Network and Digital Twin" submitted to the IEEE TNSM, which is under review.

This repo implements a genetic algorithm to decide the allocation of subchannels and transmission power, with contraints of demanding communication delay and limited resources of subchannels and power. The genetic algorithm is improved by aligning the power allocation strategy with the pattern featured by the water-filling solution of a simplified power optimization problem.

To install the required dependencies, the following command can be run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
